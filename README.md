# Task 3: Retail Orders Database â€“ Querying Fundamentals

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for Task 3 of the Killtins Data Analytics Internship. I applied basic SQL operations (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOIN) on the "Walmart Sales" dataset to extract insights.

## Files Included
- `walmart_sales.csv`: The retail dataset from Kaggle.
- `queries.sql`: SQL queries for analysis (e.g., total sales per store, average sales by holiday).
- `screenshots/`: Screenshots of query results (optional).

## Tools Used
- MYSQL (free SQL tool).

## What I Did
1. Imported the dataset into MYSQL.
2. Wrote queries to analyze sales trends, using aggregate functions like SUM() and date functions like MONTH().
3. Demonstrated JOIN with a hypothetical table.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understood MYSQL syntax and structure.
- Gained confidence in basic analytics using SQL.
- Prepared for interview questions like the difference between WHERE and HAVING.

## How to Run
1. Load `walmart_sales.csv` into your  MYSQL tool.
2. Execute queries from `queries.sql`.
