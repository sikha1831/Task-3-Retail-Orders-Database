# Task-3-Retail-Orders-Database
designed to build foundational SQL skills through hands-on practice with a retail dataset. The objective is to learn and apply basic SQL operationsâ€”such as SELECT for retrieving data, WHERE for filtering rows, ORDER BY for sorting results, GROUP BY for aggregating data (often with functions like SUM() or COUNT()), and JOIN for combining table.
